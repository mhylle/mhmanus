# MHManus AI Agent System - Quick Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ What We've Built

An autonomous AI agent system that can understand natural language requests, generate code, create tests, and learn from experience.

## âœ… Completed Features (Phases 1-10)

### Core Infrastructure
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Director agent orchestrates specialist agents
- **Task Management**: Queue-based processing with real-time updates
- **Memory System**: 4-layer memory (short-term, long-term, semantic, episodic)
- **LLM Integration**: Ollama local models with cloud provider support

### AI Capabilities
- **Code Generation**: Autonomous code creation with multiple languages
- **Test Generation**: Automatic unit test creation with coverage analysis
- **Project Scaffolding**: Complete project structure generation
- **Self-Learning**: Learns from successful executions to improve

### Execution & Tools

# Execution Output Streaming Fix

**Date**: May 30, 2025  
**Issue**: Docker exec output streaming was timing out despite successful command execution

## Problem
The execution environment was successfully running commands in Docker containers, but the HTTP requests were timing out without returning results. The issue manifested as:
- Commands executed successfully (exit code 0)
- Output was collected properly by the stream handler
- But the HTTP response never returned

## Root Causes

### 1. **File Permission Issues**
- Workspace directories were created with restrictive permissions (0o700)
- Container user (UID 1000) couldn't access the mounted workspace
- Fixed by changing permissions to 0o755 for directories and 0o644 for files

### 2. **Resource Monitor Blocking**
- The resource monitor was waiting for container exit with `container.wait()`
- Containers run `sleep 3600` to stay alive for reuse
- This caused the monitoring promise to never resolve
- Fixed by adding a timeout with `Promise.race()`

## Solutions Applied

### Permission Fixes
```typescript
// filesystem.service.ts
await fs.chmod(workspacePath, 0o755); // Changed from 0o700
await fs.chmod(filePath, 0o644); // Added explicit file permissions
```

### Resource Monitor Fix
```typescript
// execution.service.ts
const resourceMetrics = await Promise.race([
  monitoringPromise,
  new Promise<ResourceMetrics>((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve({
        cpuUsage: 0,
        memoryUsage: 0,
        peakMemory: 0,
        diskRead: 0,
        diskWrite: 0,
      });
    }, 100);
  }),
]);
```

## Results
- Execution now completes in ~500ms
- Output is properly captured and returned
- Test endpoint returns:
  ```json
  {
    "executionId": "7c4b7ed0-2a05-437e-a10b-9fe3c5ca37cb",
    "success": true,
    "stdout": "Starting test...\\nHello from file!Test complete!",
    "stderr": "",
    "exitCode": 0,
    "duration": 546,
    "files": [...]
  }
  ```

## Next Steps
- Improve resource monitoring to work with long-lived containers
- Add proper container lifecycle management
- Integrate execution service with Code Agent for automatic testing

# Revised Local-First Implementation Plan (with Observability)

## Overview
This plan prioritizes practical local development with comprehensive monitoring and observability, while deferring security and keeping cloud providers (Groq only) as low priority.

## Revised Phase Timeline

### Phase 3: Agent Architecture (Current - Weeks 5-7)
**Goal**: Build a working multi-agent system for complex task handling

#### Core Components
1. **Base Agent System**

     constructor(
       protected llm: LLMProvider,
       protected memory: MemoryService,
       protected tools: ToolRegistry,
       protected telemetry: TelemetryService  // Added for observability
     ) {}
     
     abstract async plan(task: Task): Promise<Plan>;
     abstract async execute(plan: Plan): Promise<Result>;
   }
   ```

    ports:
      - "9090:9090"
  
  # Visualization
  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana:latest
    ports:
      - "3001:3000"
    environment:
      - GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED=true
      - GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ORG_ROLE=Admin
  
  # Logs

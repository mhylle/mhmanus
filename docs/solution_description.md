On-Premises Autonomous AI Agent Architecture Using Ollama
Executive Summary
This document describes a containerized autonomous AI agent system built with Angular 19, NestJS 11, and PostgreSQL. The architecture leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as the primary intelligence layer through a flexible provider abstraction that supports both local models (via Ollama) and cloud providers (Groq, Mistral, OpenAI). This hybrid approach allows running smaller models locally on consumer GPUs while leveraging cloud providers for larger models like 70B parameter LLMs. The system features hot-swappable model configurations, enabling easy adoption of new models as they become available. It implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) standard for tool integration and includes seven functional verticals, with dedicated components for autonomous code development using best-in-class models like Mistral's Codestral. All reasoning, planning, and generation tasks are powered by LLMs, while embeddings enable intelligent memory retrieval and pattern matching across the system.

ML/AI Components Architecture
Model Provider Abstraction Layer
Flexible Model Management:
The system implements a provider-agnostic model interface that allows seamless switching between different LLM providers and models without code changes. This abstraction layer supports:

Local Models (via Ollama)

Small to medium models (7B-34B parameters)
Running on local GPU infrastructure
Examples: Llama3:7b, Mistral:7b, CodeLlama:13b


Cloud Provider Integration

Large models (70B+ parameters)
Providers: Groq, OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral API
Automatic failover between providers
Cost optimization through intelligent routing


Hybrid Deployment

Small models run locally for low-latency tasks
Large models via cloud for complex reasoning
Dynamic routing based on task requirements
Fallback chains for high availability



Concurrent Multi-Provider Usage:
The system can run multiple models from different providers simultaneously:

Director Agent using Groq's Llama3-70b for planning
Code Specialist using Mistral's Codestral-22b for generation
QA Agent using local Ollama/Llama3:7b for validation
All coordinated through the unified Model Gateway

This allows optimal model selection for each task component while managing costs and performance.
Model Configuration System:
The system uses a declarative configuration approach for model management:
yaml# config/models.yaml
model_providers:
  ollama:
    endpoint: "http://ollama:11434"
    models:
      - name: "llama3:7b"
        capabilities: ["general", "reasoning"]
      - name: "mistral:7b"
        capabilities: ["general", "fast"]
      - name: "codellama:13b"
        capabilities: ["code", "debugging"]
      
  groq:
    endpoint: "https://api.groq.com/v1"
    api_key: "${GROQ_API_KEY}"
    models:
      - name: "llama3-70b"
        capabilities: ["complex-reasoning", "planning"]
      - name: "mixtral-8x7b"
        capabilities: ["general", "fast", "efficient"]
        
  mistral:
    endpoint: "https://api.mistral.ai/v1"
    api_key: "${MISTRAL_API_KEY}"
    models:
      - name: "codestral-22b"
        capabilities: ["code", "testing", "documentation"]
      - name: "mistral-large"
        capabilities: ["reasoning", "analysis"]

agent_model_mapping:
  director:
    preferred: "groq/llama3-70b"
    fallback: ["mistral/mistral-large", "ollama/llama3:7b"]
    
  code_specialist:
    preferred: "mistral/codestral-22b"
    fallback: ["ollama/codellama:13b", "groq/mixtral-8x7b"]
    
  general_specialist:
    preferred: "ollama/mistral:7b"
    fallback: ["ollama/llama3:7b"]
Model Router Component:
The Model Router dynamically selects the appropriate model and provider based on:

Task complexity and requirements
Model availability and health
Cost considerations
Latency requirements
Current load and rate limits

Provider Adapter Pattern:
Each provider implements a common interface:

Unified prompt formatting
Response parsing
Error handling
Rate limit management
Cost tracking

Practical Model Selection Examples:

Web Development Task

Planning: Groq/Llama3-70b (complex architecture decisions)
Frontend Code: Mistral/Codestral-22b (latest framework knowledge)
Backend Code: Mistral/Codestral-22b (API design)
CSS Styling: Ollama/CodeLlama:13b (simpler task)
Testing: Ollama/CodeLlama:13b (standard patterns)
Documentation: Ollama/Mistral:7b (general writing)


Data Analysis Task

Understanding: Groq/Llama3-70b (complex requirements)
SQL Generation: Mistral/Codestral-22b (optimal queries)
Data Processing: Ollama/CodeLlama:13b (Python scripts)
Visualization: Ollama/Mistral:7b (chart configuration)
Report Writing: Ollama/Llama3:7b (summaries)


Emergency Fallback Scenario

Primary (Groq) fails → Fallback to Mistral API
Mistral API fails → Fallback to OpenAI/Anthropic
All cloud fails → Degrade to local Ollama models
Inform user of degraded capabilities
Queue complex tasks for when cloud returns



This flexible approach ensures the system remains operational even with limited resources while leveraging the best available models when possible.

Conclusion
This architecture provides a comprehensive framework for building an on-premises autonomous AI agent system with Large Language Models at its core, while maintaining complete flexibility in model selection and deployment. The provider-agnostic design allows teams to start with smaller local models on consumer hardware and seamlessly scale to larger cloud-based models as needed. By supporting multiple providers (Ollama for local, Groq for large models, Mistral for specialized coding), the system can optimize for cost, performance, and capability based on specific task requirements. The declarative model configuration ensures that adopting new models—whether it's the latest Mistral coding model or a breakthrough in open-source LLMs—requires only configuration changes, not code modifications. This flexibility, combined with Angular 19 and NestJS 11 for modern application development, PostgreSQL with pgvector for persistence and vector operations, and Docker-first deployment, creates a future-proof platform for autonomous AI agents. Each of the seven verticals can be developed and tested independently, while the combination of LLM-powered agents, embedding-based memory, and ML-enhanced operations delivers a truly autonomous digital worker capable of complex task execution and continuous learning, regardless of whether it runs on a single developer machine or a distributed enterprise infrastructure.
